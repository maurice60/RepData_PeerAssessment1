# Reproducible Research: Peer Assessment 1


## Loading and preprocessing the data

```{r}
zip <- 'activity.zip'
activity <- read.csv(unz(zip, 'activity.csv'))
daily <- aggregate(activity['steps'], by=activity['date'], FUN='sum', na.rm=TRUE)
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

```{r}
hist(daily$steps, main='Histogram of steps/day', xlab='Steps')
mean(daily$steps)
median(daily$steps)
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
